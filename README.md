Reflective Self-Correcting Code Generation AI Agent (LangGraph)

This project implements a Reflective, Self-Correcting AI Agent using LangGraph
, LangChain
, and OpenAI models.
The agent follows the Reflection Pattern: it generates code, executes it, detects errors, and refines the solution iteratively until it works

ðŸš€ Features

Code Generation â€“ Uses GPT-based models to create Python code solutions.

Execution & Reflection â€“ Runs the generated code, captures errors, and provides feedback.

Iterative Correction Loop â€“ Repeats generation and refinement until code runs without errors.

Stopping Conditions â€“ Terminates after success or after a maximum attempt threshold.

User Feedback â€“ Allows restarting refinement if the user isnâ€™t satisfied.
